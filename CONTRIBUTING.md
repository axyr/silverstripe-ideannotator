# Contributing

Yes, please! But please adhere to the following rules to keep everything neat and tidy.

## Branching and forking

When you want to contribute, please first create a fork of this repository first.

When raising a pull request, please raise it against the branch that represents the major version you're using. For example, if you're using `2.0.7` then you'll raise a pull request against the `2` branch. If you're using the latest unstable version, then raise it against the master branch.

Please ensure that your commit messages are short and describe what you are doing. Do not include GitHub issue numbers in the commit messages, but please ensure that you enter them into the pull request description.

Please try to keep everything in one commit. If needed, squash and force-push (carefully).

## Code style

Please follow the [PSR-2 coding style guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) when editing or adding new code.

## Maintainers
